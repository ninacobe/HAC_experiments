The deck has 104 cards with equal amounts of <span class=\"red\"> red </span> and <span class=\"black\"> black </span> cards. <br> In each round, you will see a pile of 52 cards from the deck for a short amount of time. <br>This Round’s Game Pile: <br><br> <img src='img/img_stimulus.png' class=\"center\"></img><br>A random card will be drawn from this round’s game pile. <br> We will ask you to state your confidence that a red card will be drawn.<img src='img/img_conf.png' class=\"center-small\"></img> <br> We will then ask you to bet on a color. <img src='img/img_bet.png' class=\"center-small\"></img> You <span class=\"orange\">win 1 point</span> in this round if you <span class=\"orange\">bet on the color of the card drawn </span> from the game pile. <br> You win no points if you bet on a different color. <img src='img/img_win.png' class=\"center-small\"></img> The points gained in the game translate into a monetary bonus. <br><br> Please, do not cheat in any kind of way! <br><br> Click next to begin.<br><br>"],
