        "<div class=\"content\">This experiment is being conducted by Nina Laura Corvelo Benz and Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez at the Max Planck Institute. <br> The purpose of this experiment is to compare how participants perform decision making with and without machine-assistance. <br><br> In this experiment, you will play a game of cards. The deck has 104 cards with equal amounts of <span class=\"red\"> red </span> and <span class=\"black\"> black </span> cards. <br> In each round, you will see a pile of 52 cards from the deck for a short amount of time. <br>Example of a round’s game pile: <br><br> <div class=\"image-container\"><img src='img/img_stimulus.png' class=\"center\"></img></div><br><br> Then, we will pick a card at random from the game pile. <br> Without showing you the picked card yet, we will first ask you what your confidence is that this card is red <br> on a five-point scale from very low to very high.<br><br> <div class=\"image-container\"><img src='img/img_conf.png' class=\"center\"></img></div> <br><br> Then, we will ask you to bet on a color. <br><br> <div class=\"image-container\"><img src='img/img_bet.png' class=\"center\"></img></div> <br><br> You <span class=\"orange\">win 1 point</span> in this round if you <span class=\"orange\"> bet on the color of the card picked </span> from the game pile. <br> You win no points if you bet on a different color.<br><br> <div class=\"image-container\"><img src='img/img_win.png' class=\"center\"></img></div><br><br> Please, do not cheat in any kind of way! <br><br> Click next to begin.<br><br></div>"],
